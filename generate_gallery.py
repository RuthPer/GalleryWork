"""I have a folder with 9 images (all as .webp). I want you to write a 
Python script (with jinja2) that will generate an HTML page that 
includes a gallery of the images from my folder. This will run locally, 
it will not be uploaded on a server. 
Include a requirement.txt file to install all libraries that might be 
needed, such as jinja2 or anything else. Make sure that the images are 
all shown in the same size. 
Also, use an external CSS stylesheet, that the jinja2 template will 
make use of yes.
